CSE 111 Proposal for a Student Chosen Program

    (This is a proposal. All proposals are written with our best
    knowledge at the beginning of a project. As we progress from the
    beginning to the end of a project, we gain more knowledge, and we
    change some of our proposed ideas. This is part of completing any
    project and is fine.  However, we still must write a proposal so
    that our teachers or supervisors know what we intend to do. Please
    answer each of the following questions to the best of your
    knowledge.)

1. What is the title of your program?

    the title for my program, is going to be "BEP calculater", 
    that stands for Break even point calculater.

2. What real-world problem will your program address or help to solve?

    Knowing your break-even point is essential to running a business. 
    Where you can check to see if you'll have enough demand to cover 
    your costs and hopefully make a profit. The program will allow 
    the user to enter their businessdata and have the program do every
    calculation for the user to have a persize information about the 
    break even point to help him better make some decisions.

3. What will you learn from developing this program?

    By developing this program I will use and learn how to use tkinter,
    how to graph and frame windows to shape my break-even point calculater.

4. What Python modules will your program use?
    
    Doing so I will use some modules just as csv, pytest
    and tkinter 

    (Some examples are: csv, datetime, functools, matplotlib, math,
    pandas, pytest, random, requests, and tkinter.)

5. Will you separate your Python program into functions that each
perform a single task?

    Yes, I will separate my program into functions just as functions to add 
    items into a list, to remove items from a list, to print a list, to 
    calculate the break even point and to calculate the net profit.

    (Remember that the most reusable functions don't get user input and
    don't print results but instead have parameters and return a result.
    Functions that get user input and print results are important and do
    useful work but are not easily reusable.)

    (Remember also that it's hard to test functions that get user input
    and print results. It's easy to test functions that don't get user
    input and don't print results but instead have parameters and return
    a result. Therefore, you should write most of your program functions
    to have parameters and return a result.)

6. Will you write test functions to test at least two of your program
functions?

    Yes, I will write test functions to make sure that my program will provide
    acurate results to the user so that there are no errs. and this I will use 
    in the functions to calculate net profit and break even point.



Since my program is aboutÂ break even point I serched on the internet about how
to calculate the break even point, revenue definations, variable costs, fixed costs.
wrote in a peace of paper how this program is going to procceed.

Also read about the tkinter module by reading and studying in the page
https://docs.python.org/3/library/tk.html and 
https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_gui_programming.htm , also 
watched the youtube video on tkinter https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hLQj47YOwOE.
I also practiced using GUI-tkinter in VS code And coded the the welcoming page of my 
program 



1 - A list of the function names in your program.
    During the coding of my program, this is the list of functions I created: main, displays, buttom_start,
buttom_1, add_b1, add_b2, buttom_2, buttom_3, buttom_4, buttom_5, total_in_list, box_entry_clear, action_remove_fixed, 
action_remove_variable, calcule_BEP, break_even_point, add_price and add_quantity.

2 - A list of the test function names in your test code.
    I was able to right a pytest code to test the functions total_in_list and break_even_point.

3 - A list of the documentation that you read, the videos that you watched, and the coding experiments that you tried.
    I went to https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_gui_programming.htm and read stuff about widgets like text, Frame, 
    place and pack. In addition, I checked Some of my personal notes I took from classes to remmeber things.

4 - A description or list of the work that you finished on your program.
    To complety my program, added an options for the user to remove any item they want to remove, I added
    another options to allow them to put the price of their product and the quantity they produced and a final 
    option called BEP where they can visualize their break even point.
